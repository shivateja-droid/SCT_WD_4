# DoNest - Your To-Do List App
## Overview

**DoNest** is a simple and elegant to-do list app built as part of my Web Development internship at SkillCraft Technology. It helps users manage their tasks efficiently by allowing them to:

- **Add** new tasks
- **Organize** tasks in lists
- **Mark** tasks as completed
- **Edit** tasks
- **Set Date & Time** for each task

The app is developed using **React** + **Vite** for fast development and hot reloading, **Tailwind CSS** for modern styling, and **React Icons** for intuitive visuals.

---

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Quickly add new tasks to your list.
- **Organize Tasks:** View all tasks in a clean, organized UI.
- **Mark as Completed:** Check off tasks as you complete them.
- **Edit Tasks:** Easily modify task details.
- **Set Date & Time:** Assign a specific date and time for each task, or leave them unset.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks you no longer need.
